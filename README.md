# Rio--125-Forecasting-System---intro of-Retail-Outlet-
The retail outlet under consideration thrives in a constantly changing and dynamic market. In order to efficiently manage inventory and meet the ever-shifting demands of customers, there arose a critical need for a smart and advanced forecasting system. This internship unfolded as a hands-on journey into the creation of precisely such a system.

Forecasting System: Project Demand of Products at Retail Outlet Based-on-historical-data
Description
The aim of this project is to develop a forecasting system to predict the demand of products at a retail store based on historical data. Leveraging time series models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and Fbprophet, this system facilitates accurate predictions to optimize inventory management and enhance operational efficiency.

Steps Involved
Load Dataset: Import the dataset into the Python environment and preprocess it by cleaning and sanitizing the data to ensure data integrity.

Choose Suitable Forecasting Model: Select the appropriate forecasting model based on the characteristics and patterns observed in the dataset. This includes exploring various time series models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and Fbprophet.

Fit Model to Dataset: Train the chosen forecasting model on the preprocessed dataset to capture the underlying trends and patterns.

Make Predictions: Utilize the fitted model to generate forecasts for future demand of products at the retail outlet.

Visualize Predictions: Visualize the forecasted demand using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights and aid in decision-making processes.

Project Outcome
Gain insights into different time series forecasting models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, and Fbprophet.
Utilize the Statsmodel library for implementing statistical models and explore the functionalities of the Fbprophet library.
Enhance proficiency in Python programming and data manipulation techniques.
Learn to effectively preprocess and clean datasets for analysis.
Develop visualization skills for communicating forecasted trends and patterns.
